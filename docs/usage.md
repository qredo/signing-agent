# Usage guide for the Signing Agent

[TOC]

## Introduction

The Signing Agent is an agent that can operate as a standalone service (exposing a RESTful API to 3rd party applications), or as a library integrated into an application. We recommend deploying the service on premise, on the customerâ€™s infrastructure. We also recommend that every Signing Agent instance be used to manage a unique agent ID, and that multiple instances be deployed (preferably on different cloud infrastructures) in order to meet a multiple signer threshold such as 2 or 3 out of 5. The Signing Agent uses a dedicated subset of the Qredo Server APIs, called the Partner API, to perform its functions. It can also be used to create a programmable approver service that listens to incoming approval requests over Websockets, and is then able to perform automated custody.

In a nutshell, it works just like the phone app but without the human element. The server acts just like a human approver, which means that it *approves* all transaction types that move assets to and from a Qredo wallet:

- **transfer** - (also transfer out) a transaction between wallets that both reside on the Qredo Network: a L2 to L2 transaction.
- **withdrawal** - a transaction where assets in a Qredo wallet move to a wallet outside the Qredo Network (BTC, ETH, etc.): a L2 to L1 transaction).
- **atomic swap** - a transfer out transaction where you offer a certain amount of an asset in exchange for a (transfer in) certain amount of another asset. (e.g. exchange 100000000 ETH qweis for 735601 satoshis). Both parties that participate have a transfer out transaction that undergoes custody with their approvers. This transaction type is discussed in more detail in the [Atomic swaps](https://developers.qredo.com/partner-api/how-tos/atomic-swap/) section of the Qredo documentation portal.

## Cloud-based storage for secrets

An alternative to storing the signing-agent configuration on-premises in a file, is to use secure cloud-based storage. The following cloud-based solutions are supported.

### Oracle Cloud Vault Storage

In the YAML configuration file:

```yaml

store:
  oci:
    vault: ocid1.vault....
    secretEncryptionKey: ocid1.key....
    compartment: ocid1.tenancy....
    configSecret: signing_agent_config
  ...
```

- Setup an API key on Oracle Cloud
- Download the config file for the api key, fill in the correct private key path
- Either put the file in its default location of ~/.oci/config or
  put it in a custom location and set env var OCI_CONFIG_FILE to the full path including the filename
- Create a vault and copy the OCID to the config file for the vault setting
- Create an encryption key (AES or RSA) in the vault, copy it's OCID to the config secretEncryptionKey setting
- Copy the compartment OCID from the compartment where the vault was created
- Set a secret name where the signing agent will store its configuration and keys
- Start the signing agent and register an agent using the API

### AWS Cloud Secrets Manager Storage

In order to use AWS for configuration storage, set the `storage_type` to `aws` and provide the AWS Region and the name of the Secrets Manager secret. For example, your YAML config should look something like the following:

```yaml
store:
  aws:
    region: eu-west-2
    configSecret: signingAgentConfig
  ...
```

The Secrets Manager secret (i.e., `signAgentConfig` in this example) needs to be setup in advance. To do this, on the AWS console:

1. Create a KMS customer-managed key to be used to encrypt the Secrets Manager secret
2. Create the Secrets Manager secret, naming it and including the KMS key from step 1
   - Select `Other type of secret`
   - Select `Plaintext` and enter `initialise me`
   - From the Encryption key drop-down, select the key created in step 1
   - Name the secret and optionally add a description
3. Update the Signing Agent's configuration file with the AWS region and secret name

Start the Signing Agent and register the agent using the API. (Note: starting the Agent converts the secret's type
from plaintext to binary.)

**Note:** the Signing Agent needs access to AWS credentials in order to use AWS' Secrets Manager.  How you do this is
dependent on your requirements (for instance, the use of AWS access keys or an AWS credentials file, etc.) but, importantly,
if running the Signing Agent in a docker container, the AWS credentials need to be available to the Agent running in the
container.  This would require passing the AWS credential data to docker at startup.  As an example, AWS access keys can be
passed as environment variables:
```shell
> docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ...
```
or, if using an AWS credential data contained in a local directory, something like this:
```shell
> docker run -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws ...
```
Specifics are best discussed with your cloud services admin department.

## Using Signing Agent as a Service

As mentioned above, the Signing Agent is a standalone component of the Qredo ecosystem. Everyone who intends to run an Signing Agent must first register it on the Qredo network. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the registration process, which involves the *PartnerAPP* (e.g. your app), the *signing-agent-service* (e.g. Signing Agent running on your infrastructure), and *QredoBE* (e.g. our Qredo back-end).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
  PartnerAPP->>signing-agent-service:POST /register {"name":"...","APIKey":"...","Base64PrivateKey":"..."}
  signing-agent-service->>signing-agent-service: Generate BLS and EC Keys
  signing-agent-service->>QredoBE: Register agent with Qredo Chain
  QredoBE->>signing-agent-service: {agentID, feedURL, other data}
  signing-agent-service->>PartnerAPP: {agentID, feedURL}
```

1. The *PartnerApp* triggers the registration process by providing its client name, parther APIKey and Base64PrivateKey  to the *signing-agent-service*.
2. *signing-agent-service* generates BLS and EC keys.
3. The *signing-agent-service* can now register itself to the partner API on the *QredoBE*, by sending the `client name`, `BLS`, and `EC` public keys. The *QredoBE* is returning ClientID, CLientSecret that will be responsible for authentication.
4. The `agentID` and a `feedURL` is returned by the *QredoBE* to the *signing-agent-service*. This feed is used by the *signing-agent-service* to keep a communication channel open with the *QredoBE*.
5. The `agentID` and a `feedURL` is also passed along to the *PartnerApp* so that the latter can monitor for new actions that need to be approved in case the service is not configured for auto-approval.

All the data above is currently stored on premises in a file by the signing-agent-service, and since some of it (ClientSecret, EC & BLS private keys) is quite sensitive it needs to be running in a secure environment.

**Note:** an always up to date API documentation can be accessed within the [Github repo](https://github.com/qredo/signing-agent/blob/master/docs/swagger/swagger.yaml).

## API

### POST /api/v1/register

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "APIKey": "string",
  "Base64PrivateKey": "string"
}
```

Response (AgentRegisterResponse):

```json
{
  "agentID": "string",
  "feedURL": "string"
}
```

## Using Signing Agent as a Library

There are times when the Signing Agent benefits from being tightly coupled with an application or a service. In this case, it can be imported as a Go package directly into that application.

 An example of the Signing Agent onboarding process using the Signing Agent library in a Go app would look like:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP:ClientRegister('client_name')

  rect rgb(200, 150, 255)
  note right of PartnerAPP: inside the Signing Agent lib
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: Generate BLS and EC Keys
  end

  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE: ClientInit(reqDataInit, RefID, APIKey, Base64PrivateKey) reqDataInit: {name, BLS & EC PubKeys}
  QredoBE->>QredoBE: Create New MFA ID, New IDDoc
  QredoBE->>PartnerAPP:{ClientSecret, ClientID, unsigned IDDoc, AccountCode}
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: ClientRegisterFinish(ClientSercert, ID, unsigned IDDoc, AccountCode)
  rect rgb(200, 150, 255)
  note right of PartnerAPP: inside the Signing Agent lib
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: Store ClientSercert, ID, AccountCode
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: Sign IDDoc
  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE: POST /p/coreclient/finish { IDdoc Signature }
  end
  QredoBE->>QredoBE: Save IDDoc in qredochain
  QredoBE->>PartnerAPP: {feedURL}
```

## Approving a transaction

Prerequisites:

- a Signing Agent service instance has been installed and configured
- a signing-agent has been created with id `agentID`

Steps:

1. A websocket connection to the *Qredo BE* is opened for said `agentID`
2. *PartnerAPP* is constantly monitoring for new actions to be handled
3. A new transfer is initiated
4. The *Qredo BE* returns the transaction id: `tx_id`
5. Shortly after, a new action is received through the websocket with `action_id` equal to the `tx_id` for the transfer.
6. Initiate new action
7. The *PartnerAPP* requests from the *Qredo BE* details for the action
8. *Qredo BE* returns action details incl. the payload (list of messages)
9. Sign payload (for the new action)
10. The *PartnerAPP* decides to approve the transactions, thus sending the payload to the signing-agent with a `PUT` request. (`DELETE` is for reject)

After that sequence, the transaction should be complete.

## Using the library to approve a transaction

  par
  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE: WEBSOCKET /coreclient/feed
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: monitor for new actions
  end
  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE:POST /company/{company_id}/transfer
  QredoBE->>PartnerAPP: tx_id
  QredoBE->>PartnerAPP: {via websocket } action_id(==tx_id), type, status
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: ActionApprove(actionID)
  rect rgb(200, 150, 255)
  note right of PartnerAPP: inside the Signing Agent lib
  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE: GET /coreclient/action/{action_id}
  QredoBE->>PartnerAPP: action details incl. list of messages
  PartnerAPP->>PartnerAPP: signing those messages
  PartnerAPP->>QredoBE: PUT /coreclient/action/{action_id} send signed messages to BE

  end
```
