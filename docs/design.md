# Registration process (step-by-step explanation)

Below is a step-by-step explanation of the registration process, which involves the *PartnerApp* (e.g. Banco Hipotecario Partner Application), the *signing-agent-service* (e.g. Signing Agent running on Banco Hipotecarioâ€™s infrastructure), and *QredoBE* (e.g. our Qredo back-end).

  AA->>Q: POST /p/client/init Body: {BLS & EC Public Keys}
  Q->>Q: Create new MFA ID, New IDdoc
  Q->>AA: {ID, AccountCode, ClientID, ClientSecret, unsigned IDdoc}
  AA->>AA: Store ID, ClientSecret, ClientID, AccountCode
  AA->>AA: Sign IDDoc
  AA->>Q: POST /p/client/finish { IDdoc Signature }
  Q->>Q: Save IDdoc in qredochain
  Q->>AA: {feedURL}
  AA->>PA: {feedURL, agentID}
```

1. The *PartnerApp* triggers the registration process by providing its client name, parther APIKey and Base64PrivateKey  to the *signing-agent-service*.
2. *signing-agent-service* generates BLS and EC keys. 
3. *signing-agent-service* storage BLS and EC keys. 
4. The *signing-agent-service* can now register itself to the partner API on the *QredoBE*, by sending the `client name`, `BLS`, and `EC` public keys.
11. The `agentId` and a `feedURL` is returned by the *QredoBE* to the *signing-agent-service*. This feed is used by the *signing-agent-service* to keep a communication channel open with the *QredoBE*.
12. The `agentId` and a `feedURL` is also passed along to the *PartnerApp* so that the latter can monitor for new actions that need to be approved in case the service is not configured for auto-approval.
